### What is this package?

This package is a nice little tool designed to provide a good way to generalize forms data and their basic interactions.

### Why is necessary?

Quite a while ago I was leading development of an ambitious web project which used React in the front end. I quickly found that the creation of the forms is way too repetitive. Basically, most of the time developers were doing the same thing. They were manually creating the form state and data structure, in addition, they were trying to implement complex behavior using callbacks and chaotically placed state fields.  Therefore I made a small tool which simplified their lives a lot.  And now I want to share it with the world.
